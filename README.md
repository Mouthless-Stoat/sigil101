# Sigil in IMF

This is the bare markdown for the `A Guide to IMF Sigil` book. If you want the render book go [here](https://mouthless-stoat.github.io/sigil101/).

> IDL to call this a guide or a book. It could be consider a book based on how long it is but idk.

All the Chapter is in [`src`][./src/]. Each chapter should have it own folder with all the chapter label. The listing and file are also there in `listings`.

If you came looking for the old version of the book look at the [`old` branch](https://github.com/Mouthless-Stoat/sigil101/tree/old).
