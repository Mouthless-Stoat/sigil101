# Getting Started

Time to start getting all your tool set up to start making custom sigils. We will download:

-   [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org): Your main environment to write and test custom sigils.
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com): Your main text editor to write and validate ruleset file.

Along with downloading these tools we will also look at how to use and navigate them. We will also look at other tools that might be useful to you when looking through the game source code. A [GitHub](https://github.com) account might also help to look for snippet of code on the fly.
