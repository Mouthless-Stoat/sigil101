# Chapter 2: Hello Programming

> If you already know how to program feel free to skip this chapter. If you come from another programming language you can skim through this chapter to understand the basic of `gdscript` syntax.

Coding is a crucial part of making custom sigils because they rely on code to function. We will be coding in `gdscript` in this chapter and beyond. Normally we will run `gdscript` **within** Godot but this chapter will get you to code in `gdscript` **outside** of Godot. In this chapter we will talk about everything you need to know to be a programmer. Feel free to look up more info for part that you do not understand like on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for getting answer (not so much for asking question), you can also ask in the [IMF Discord Server](https://discord.gg/wXS2FpJpCt). In this chapter, we will cover the following:

-   **Variable**: Variables are use to store value to be reuse later.
-   **Operator**: Operator allow computation to be done like math and comparison.
-   **Types**: Types are different data type and we will see how they interact
-   **Conditionals**: Conditional can help us run code based on if a condition is meet.
-   **Looping**: Loop allow for repeating code without manually typing the same snippet over and over again.
-   **Functions**: Functions are use to group a section of code together to be reuse like variables but for code.
-   **Objects**: Object are powerful tool that Godot is build on top of and we will learn how to utilise them.
-   **Extra Exercises**: Provide more exercise for you to practice your programming skill.

There are a few activities and exercises at the end of each chapter this will have a few simple project for you to do to recap what you learn.
