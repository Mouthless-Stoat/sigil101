# Variables

> We assume from now on that you know to put code in ceremony and all that jazz.

One of the first concept we will talk about is variables, what they are and how to use them. Variable are container that we can use to store a piece of data or value to be use later. Let take a look at defining a variable

```gd
var x = 10
```

This will make a new variable call `x` and it will contain the value (or number) `10`. Variables can have different data type store in them, `x` in this case is storing a number and the number value is `10`
