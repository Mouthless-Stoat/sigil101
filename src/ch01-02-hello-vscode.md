# Hello Vscode

Time to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (vscode), you can just go to that page click on download and launch the `.exe` file.

> Again you could choose not to download vscode and continue using notepad or whatever text editor you prefer. Notepad however don't really have any support to code in any languages so it very easy to make mistake while editing `json` file. If you are using other text editor like Sublime Text or Notepad++, consider looking up how to configure them to show `json` error.

## Navigation

Along the top you should see `File`, `Edit`, `Selection`, etc. Among these only `File` is really important if you click on it a menu will pop down in this menu you can find `Open File`, `Open Folder` and `Preferences`. You can use `Open File` to open well files to edit using vscode, `Open Folder` won't be use as much but will also be helpful when looking at multiple ruleset file. Lastly `Preferences` is where you can edit your setting and configure vscode to your liking. One of these setting you might want is `Autosave` to well automatically save your file for you.
